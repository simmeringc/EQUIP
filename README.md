## EQUIP Observation Web Application

EQUIP stands for 'Equity Quantified in Participation', and is a web application designed to aid in collecting and analyzing observational data.

The tool was created to give Ph.D researchers observing a classroom the University of Colorado Boulder a template for their observations and an easy way to track them. Subjects with custom characteristics can be placed in an environment and a dynamic sequence of data can be collected based on that subject's behavior. The default sequence is data that can be codified into a quantifiable result for subject participation in a classroom, but custom sequence and subject parameters can be added to let a researcher track subject behavior for any heuristic.
